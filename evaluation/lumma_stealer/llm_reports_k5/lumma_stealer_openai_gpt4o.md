# SECURITY INCIDENT ANALYSIS

## FINDINGS

**1. What is the IP address of the infected Windows client?**
FINAL ANSWER = 10.1.21.58
CITED CHUNKS = [kerberos_clients_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json, suspicious_domains_result.json, kerberos_full_services_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json, kerberos_clients_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json, suspicious_domains_result.json, kerberos_full_services_result.json]
**2. What is the host name of the infected Windows client?**
FINAL ANSWER = desktop-es9f3ml
CITED CHUNKS = [kerberos_hostnames_result.json, kerberos_full_services_result.json, kerberos_clients_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [kerberos_hostnames_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, suspicious_domains_result.json, kerberos_full_services_result.json, kerberos_clients_result.json]
**3. What is the Windows human user account name (not machine accounts ending in $) of the potentially infected machine in the LAN?**
FINAL ANSWER = [gwyatt]
CITED CHUNKS = [kerberos_clients_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [kerberos_full_services_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, kerberos_clients_result.json, suspicious_domains_result.json]
**4. What domain and IP address triggered the alert for Lumma Stealer?**
The domain "whitepepper.su" triggered the alert for Lumma Stealer.
The IP address "10.1.21.58" triggered the alert for Lumma Stealer.

FINAL ANSWER = [whitepepper.su, 10.1.21.58]
CITED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [suspicious_domains_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json, kerberos_full_services_result.json]
**5. Which of the three CIA components does the attacker target primarily: availability, integrity, or confidentiality?**
Based on the provided security data, the attacker primarily targets the confidentiality component of the CIA triad. This is evident from the numerous alerts related to malware domains, suspicious DNS queries, and observed CnC domains, indicating a focus on unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

FINAL ANSWER = Confidentiality
CITED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json, suspicious_domains_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [kerberos_full_services_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, kerberos_clients_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, suspicious_domains_result.json]
**6. During what hour did the first signs of infection activity appear? Provide the earliest date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC format.**
The first signs of infection activity appeared on 2026-01-27 23:00 UTC.
FINAL ANSWER = [2026-01-27 23:00]
CITED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, high_activity_external_dest_result.json, suspicious_domains_result.json]
**7. According to the connection volume statistics, what single external IP address received the most connections from the infected hosts? Is it a C2 server or a legitimate service?**
The single external IP address that received the most connections from the infected hosts is 153.92.1.49. This IP address is associated with the domain whitepepper.su, which is flagged as a malicious domain related to the Win32/Lumma Stealer malware.

FINAL ANSWER = [153.92.1.49 - whitepepper.su (Win32/Lumma Stealer)]
CITED CHUNKS = [suspicious_domains_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, high_activity_external_dest_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [suspicious_domains_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, high_activity_external_dest_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json]

## SUMMARY

The security incident analysis identified an attack targeting the confidentiality component of the CIA triad, with indicators such as malware domains, suspicious DNS queries, and observed CnC domains. The infected Windows client's IP address was determined to be 10.1.21.58, with the host name being desktop-es9f3ml. Recommended actions include investigating the domain "whitepepper.su" and taking measures to enhance network security to prevent unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
