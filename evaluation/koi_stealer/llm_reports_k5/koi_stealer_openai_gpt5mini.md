- img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net
- oneclient.sfx.ms
- mapweatherdata.blob.core.windows.net
- 79.124.78.197
- ctldl.windowsupdate.com
- www.msftconnecttest.com
- x1.c.lencr.org

FINAL ANSWER = [sso.godaddy.com, www.bellantonicioccolato.it, img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net, oneclient.sfx.ms, mapweatherdata.blob.core.windows.net, 79.124.78.197, ctldl.windowsupdate.com, www.msftconnecttest.com, x1.c.lencr.org]

**5. What are the suspicious external IP addresses contacted, which might be involved in command-and-control (C2) communication?**
The suspicious external IP addresses contacted, which might be involved in command-and-control (C2) communication are:
- 79.124.78.197

FINAL ANSWER = [79.124.78.197]
CITED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [suspicious_domains_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json, kerberos_full_services_result.json]
**6. Which of the three CIA components does the attacker target primarily: availability, integrity, or confidentiality?**
Based on the provided security data, the attacker primarily targets the confidentiality component of the CIA triad. This is evident from the numerous Kerberos and LDAP-related activities associated with the source IP 172.17.0.99, indicating unauthorized access attempts to sensitive authentication and directory services.

FINAL ANSWER = Confidentiality
CITED CHUNKS = [kerberos_full_services_result.json, kerberos_clients_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [kerberos_full_services_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, kerberos_clients_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json]
**7. During what hour did the first signs of infection activity appear? Provide the earliest date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC format.**
Based on the provided security data, the first signs of infection activity appeared on 2024-09-04 at 17:00 UTC.

FINAL ANSWER = [2024-09-04 17:00]
CITED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, high_activity_external_dest_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json]
**8. According to the connection volume statistics, what single external IP address received the most connections from the infected hosts? Is it a C2 server or a legitimate service?**
The external IP address that received the most connections from the infected hosts is 79.124.78.197, with 218 connections. It is not possible to determine if it is a C2 server or a legitimate service based on the provided data.

FINAL ANSWER = [79.124.78.197]
CITED CHUNKS = [high_activity_external_dest_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [suspicious_domains_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, high_activity_external_dest_result.json, file_downloads_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json]

## SUMMARY

The security incident analysis identified a potentially infected internal host in the LAN with the IP address 172.17.0.99 and the hostname "desktop-rnvo9at." The Windows human user account associated with this machine was also determined to be "desktop-rnvo9at." The analysis revealed several likely fake or suspicious domains/URLs for initial infection, including sso.godaddy.com and www.bellantonicioccolato.it. Additionally, a suspicious external IP address, 79.124.78.197, was identified as potentially involved in command-and-control communication, recommending further investigation and mitigation actions.
