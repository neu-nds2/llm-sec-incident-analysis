**4. What external domains or IP addresses are associated with the initial infection and malware delivery?**
FINAL ANSWER = antnosience.com, dilimoretast.com, otectagain.top, seaskysafe.com, suncoastpinball.com, filebin.net, situla.bitbit.net
CITED CHUNKS = suspicious_domains_result.json

The external domains associated with the initial infection and malware delivery are antnosience.com, dilimoretast.com, otectagain.top, seaskysafe.com, suncoastpinball.com, filebin.net, and situla.bitbit.net as evidenced by the source IPs and destination IPs in the [suspicious_domains_result.json] data.

**5. What are the suspicious external IP addresses contacted, which might be involved in command-and-control (C2) communication?**
The suspicious external IP addresses contacted, which might be involved in command-and-control communication, are:
- 157.245.142.66
- 91.193.16.181

FINAL ANSWER = [157.245.142.66, 91.193.16.181]
CITED CHUNKS = [suspicious_domains_result.json, high_activity_external_dest_result.json]

**6. During what hour did the first signs of infection activity appear? Provide the earliest date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC format.**
The first signs of infection activity appeared on 2022-03-21 20:00 UTC.
FINAL ANSWER = [2022-03-21 20:00]
CITED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json]

RETRIEVED CHUNKS = [suricata_alerts_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, suricata_alerts_result.json, high_activity_external_dest_result.json, kerberos_hostnames_result.json, file_downloads_result.json, suspicious_domains_result.json]
**7. According to the connection volume statistics, what single external IP address received the most connections from the infected hosts? Is it a C2 server or a legitimate service?**
FINAL ANSWER = 157.245.142.66
CITED CHUNKS = [suspicious_domains_result.json, high_activity_external_dest_result.json]

The single external IP address that received the most connections from the infected hosts is 157.245.142.66, as evidenced by the data in the [suspicious_domains_result.json] and [high_activity_external_dest_result.json] chunks. Further analysis is needed to determine if it is a C2 server or a legitimate service.

## SUMMARY

The security incident analysis identified the potentially infected internal host in the LAN as having the IP address 10.0.19.14 and the hostname desktop-5qs3d5d. The external domains associated with the initial infection and malware delivery were antnosience.com, dilimoretast.com, otectagain.top, seaskysafe.com, suncoastpinball.com, filebin.net, and situla.bitbit.net. Additionally, suspicious external IP addresses involved in command-and-control communication were identified as 157.245.142.66 and 91.193.16.181. Recommended actions include investigating and blocking these domains and IP addresses to prevent further attacks.
